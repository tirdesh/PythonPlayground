        ## Iterative Approach
        # Time complexity: O(n) - Iterates through each node of the linked list once, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.
        # Space complexity: O(1) - Uses constant extra space regardless of the size of the input linked list.

        ## Recursive Approach
        # Time complexity: O(n) - The algorithm visits each node exactly once, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.
        # Space complexity: O(n) - Due to the recursion, the algorithm utilizes additional space on the call stack proportional to the number of nodes in the list.
