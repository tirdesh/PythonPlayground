For each character, it performs a constant number of operations to check if it is alphanumeric and to append it to the string `k`. Additionally, the code compares the string `k` with its reverse using slicing (`k[::-1]`), which also takes linear time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input string `s`.
